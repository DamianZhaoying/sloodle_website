<b>Topics covered</b>
</p><p>The Spring Builders group met in Second Life at the R &amp; D Building and tested out Greylin’s newly created couch. Jeremy mentioned he sent out a solicitation email requesting Second Life Guides for the fall semester as credit under course 298 - Special Studies. 
</p><p>Greylin and Jeremy talked about the tour they gave to Libr 262 – Resources for Young Adults faculty and students. They discussed the “digital divide” among those attending and the need to expose visitors to the Second Life School of Library and Information Science campus without overloading them with technical jargon, as many of the visitors are unfamiliar with Second Life in general. Greylin pointed out that currently the faculty are mostly interested in what they can DO in Second Life, not how they can do it. Jeremy noted that they need support and ideas for how to use the Second Life system and that this support can be found in the wiki. Greylin mentioned that some visitors may benefit from a presentation detailing basic history and use of Second Life prior to logging inworld, similar to a presentation she had done in the past; however, even though she had given written tutorials and for two weeks before the tour had been advising people to log into Second Life to prepare, she was shocked to find out that at the time the tour began, some didn’t even know how to create Second Life accounts. Jeremy mentioned the “strong urge to panic” amongst visitors new to Second Life and Greylin underscored the importance of distracting them from panicking over the technology and showing them what they can DO in Second Life. Greylin mentioned that one visitor particularly enjoyed the outdoor classrooms and faculty offices and saw potential use for them.
</p><p>Greylin talked about short beginners’ video she created that details basic movement controls (available for viewing at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZlRBUc3uYM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZlRBUc3uYM</a>). Using  Adobe’s Vlog It, Greylin found that it took approximately one half hour to create one minute of video with narration and capture and editing. After watching the video, Fidgette and Jeremy pointed out that the video is PC-specific, as Mac users use the “e” and “c” keys to fly up and down, instead of the page up and page down keys used by PC users and detailed in the video. Jeremy also pointed out that one Mac-specific problem is that the use of “e” and “c” (instead of page up and page down) as movement controls means that Mac users can only fly when the chat window is closed.
</p><p>Frunobulax mentioned that he was able to find the short 1929 film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog) by Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali available for download as a QuickTime file at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.archive.org/details/ChienAndalou">http://www.archive.org/details/ChienAndalou</a>. Jeremy stated that SLIS has a QuickTime server, and that he would process and upload the video. This is an update from the April 3, 2007 meeting in which Frunobulax indicated his intention to show the video at the Surreal World Café in the Student Union. 
</p><p>Jeremy mentioned that he had taken film around the island, including the “vPort” build and Greylin’s book talk booth (Booth A), in preparation for the presentation tentatively set for April 17, 2007. The group moved the meeting to Greylin’s booth where the group admired the work done in the booth so far. Greylin talked about her plans to add six more titles to the booth, as well as adding Sim Teach and site terminals.
</p><p><br />
<b>New items discussed</b>
</p><p>- There is a presentation tentatively scheduled for noon on April 17, 2007. Jeremy indicated that there is a need for a stage and for event promotion and management.
</p><p>- The first live event is planned for Mid-May. A live video stream will be offered of Dr. Daniel Livingstone who will be visiting from the University of Paisley, Scotland.
</p><p>- EmanonEvahi Dwi has been researching copyright permissions.
</p><p>- Jeremy mentioned that the president-elect of the AECT group for EdTech indicated an interest in having a Second Life track at their national conference.
</p><p>- Jeremy presented to Dr. Helen Barrett, the guru of ePortfolios, and with her help tweaked the technical requirements for SLIS to meet Second Life requirements (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://slisweb.sjsu.edu/ecommunication/homecomputing.htm">http://slisweb.sjsu.edu/ecommunication/homecomputing.htm</a>). 
</p><p>- Jeremy plans to meet with SLIS professor and director Dr. Ken Haycock on April 13, 2007 to present work done so far on the Second Life SLIS Campus.
