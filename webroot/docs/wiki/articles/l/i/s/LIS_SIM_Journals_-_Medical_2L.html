</p><p>Simulation offers an important context for clinical education, providing a structured, safe and supportive environment bridging the classroom and the clinic. Two trends in the simulation community appear to be developing uncritically and without adequate evaluation. First, there is a fascination with seductive high-fidelity simulation realized through sophisticated technology. Second, simulation has increasingly appropriated learning in the psychological domain, such as communication skills, under the rationale of 'integration'. Developments in simulation activities have largely been made in a theoretical vacuum and where theory is invoked it is learning theory rather than theory of simulation. This paper introduces theories of simulation from cultural studies as a critical balance to the claims of the simulation community. Work-based and simulation-based learning could engage in a new dialogue for an effective clinical education. Practice points •Learning by simulation can become self-referential to offer a simulation of learning. •Work-based learning requires effective structuring such as provision for hands-on practice, support, feedback and reflection. •Learning by simulation can be more effectively theorized to inform practice. •The interaction between effective simulation and work-based learning can increase the power of both.

</p><p>This hybrid review-case study introduces three-dimensional (3-D) virtual worlds and their educational potential to medical/health librarians and educators. Second life is perhaps the most popular virtual world platform in use today, with an emphasis on social interaction. We describe some medical and health education examples from Second Life, including Second Life Medical and Consumer Health Libraries (Healthinfo Island—funded by a grant from the US National Library of Medicine), and VNEC (Virtual Neurological Education Centre—developed at the University of Plymouth, UK), which we present as two detailed ‘case studies’. The pedagogical potentials of Second Life are then discussed, as well as some issues and challenges related to the use of virtual worlds.

One example is the web site, Second Life, wherein a three-dimensional virtual world is built and owned entirely by its residents, the end users. There are also other great examples of the use of virtual worlds in health care education. These would include the Dartmouth College's Synthetic Environments for Emergency Response Stimulation, the multiuser immersive environment by the Institute of Rural Health Idaho State University, the cyber community of the Centers for Disease Control and the virtual relay for raising money by the American Cancer Society.; The article discusses the significance of various online nursing education in the U.S. Internet and Web 2.0 technologies can create simulated experiences that are helpful to nursing.
