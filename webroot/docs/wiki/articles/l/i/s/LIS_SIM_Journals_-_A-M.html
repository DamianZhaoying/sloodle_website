<p>Purpose - The rapid rise of Multi-User Virtual Environments (MUVEs) or Metaverses, presents opportunities and challenges for the societies in the physical world and a particular challenge for education. This work aims to identify the key issues confronting education as it moves from its cohort model, K-16, to an evolving life long experience, P-to-Gray, decoupling certification from knowledge acquisition. Design/methodology/approach - Experimentation with MUVEs in education are combined with a review of the critical literature to yield an analysis of the current situation. Findings - Education is evolving, and the MUVE's are also evolving both technically and culturally. Thus we will see significant changes in both current, brick space, education as well as e-learning. Practical implications - Education will be life-long learning, often ungraded, and blended between brick spaced learning and participation in virtual cultural experiences. Originality/value - Mirror worlds, or simulations, will be important, not just in the current "brick-space", but also in the virtual worlds which will be accepted as one accepts "travel abroad".

</li></ul>
<p>Research results concerning the evaluation of a collaborative virtual learning environment (CVLE) are presented in this paper. The focus of the evaluation is the perceptions of the learners concerning the technical and social qualities of a CVLE. It is argued in this paper that course designers and system developers should put efforts to build technically robust CVLEs with proper social infrastructure. The research results showed that although some of the failures experienced by users in CVLEs are based on technological reasons, some others are based on the lack of proper social arrangements. Additionally, if CVLEs are implemented in an international environment special attention should be paid for language and cultural differences. This research also argues about the evaluation of CVLEs that should follow a socio-technical approach, to cover both technological and social issues.

<p>The article focuses on the important role of online learning in driving innovation in both core curriculum and professional development areas in the educational system in the U.S. With the sustained, dramatic growth across the nation, online learning's adaptability is proving itself well-suited to the 21st century. A study conducted in 2006 revealed that 38 states have already established state-led online learning programs, policies regulating online learning, or, both. Furthermore, the state government of Michigan in 2007 became the first to require high school students to take at least one online course for graduation.

<p>This report considers the factors that affect students' usage of virtual learning environments (VLE). In particular it explores students' reluctance to engage in the interactive components of the VLE that are essential elements to the learning process. A study at Coventry University found that many students felt embarrassed to use the on-line facilities, In order for students to use the VLE to its fullest potential, it is suggested that students should not simply be expected to embrace this new form of learning without suitable support and guidance from tutors.

</li></ul>
<p>This study explores learning and instruction within a technology-rich, collaborative, participatory learning environment by tracking the emergence of shared understanding and products through student and teacher practices. The focus is not only on the interactions among students or between students and teachers, but on student-resource interactions, especially student-technology interactions. In a 1-week camp, students worked in activity groups with 3-dimensional modeling software to develop virtual worlds. Holistic accounts of 2 activity groups in the camp are presented, emphasizing the focus of the activity, group dynamics including the role of the teacher, and the historical development of learner practices. Then, a network methodology is used to trace the history of interactions accounting for the emergence, evolution, and diffusion of learner practices. The findings suggest that becoming knowledgeably skillful with respect to a particular practice or concept is a multigenerational process, evolving in terms of contextual demands and available resources. The tracings further reveal the reciprocal nature of learning and doing, with building conceptual understanding occurring in relation to local conditions and practices, and doing practices being a part of student learning.

<p>Many studies have shown that students learn best when a variety of teaching methods are used, and that different students respond best to different methods. To this end, computers are being used more and more as teaching tools, to provide students with a wider variety of learning experiences. These approaches include multimedia presentations, computerized question-and-answer sessions, and some quite realistic simulations of situations too complex, costly, or hazardous to bring into the classroom.  This paper addresses the application of virtual reality as a new educational tool, designed to get students more deeply immersed in the computer simulations, and to present educational experiences not possible using other methods.  Details of the virtual reality based educational program Vicher are presented, along with a discussion of our experiences using the program as part of an undergraduate chemical reaction engineering course.

<p>As the use of the Internet and time spent on the Internet by individuals grows, and the use of virtual worlds like Active Worlds and Second Life increases, the library needs to have an interactive place and role in these worlds as well as a bricks and mortar space. This article provides an overview of what some libraries are doing in these worlds, especially on a collaborative library project in Second Life that was set up by two of the authors, Bell and Pope. The authors discuss and share successes and challenges with the project, how libraries are very relevant in these worlds, and how they can create partnerships with educators.

</li></ul>
<p>Computer-based learning environments commonly comprise various linguistic as well as static and dynamic pictorial representations, frequently combined with the possibility to modify them interactively. While multiple and interactive external representations have the potential to improve learning in specific ways, they also place specific demands on learners. For instance, learners have to process and relate different representations, to control and evaluate their interactions with these representations, and to construct a coherent mental representation. In many cases, learners are not able to meet these demands and suffer from cognitive overload. Taking advantage of cognitive load theory, we try to improve learning with multiple and interactive representations by reducing extraneous cognitive load and by increasing germane cognitive load which is supposed to be related to learning processes. To accomplish this, we encourage learners to actively integrate different representations and to interact with them in a structured and reflective way. We implemented these measures into the statistics learning environment VISUALSTAT and evaluated them experimentally. An analysis of variance revealed (1) that the active integration of different representations improved learning significantly, and (2) that the structured interaction with different representations increased verbal comprehension.

</li></ul>
<p>This paper reports work in progress on the analysis and visualization of the spatial and temporal distribution of user interaction data collected in three-dimensional (3-D) virtual worlds. Two tools are introduced. The "WorldMapper" reads in a so-called propdump file and creates a 2-D clickable map showing the layout of the world as well as interaction possibilities such as teleports and clickable web links. The second tool visualizes user interaction data such as navigation, chatting, and Web access activity overlaid on the world map. Resulting visualizations are meant to support social navigation, design evaluation and optimization, and the study of virtual communities. Both tools are demonstrated on a 19-person information treasure hunt for information in a 3-D virtual world. The paper concludes with a discussion and an outlook.

</li></ul>
<p>This paper presents a visualization tool set that can be used to visualize the evolution of three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments, the distribution of their virtual inhabitants over time and space, the formation and diffusion of groups, the influence of group leaders, and the environmental and social influences on chat and diffusion patterns for small (1–100 participants) but also rather large user groups (more than 100 participants). The techniques are applied to analyze and visualize data recorded during events in virtual worlds, as well as simulated data, but are also applicable to real-world data. Resulting visualizations can and have been used to ease social navigation in 3D virtual worlds, help evaluate and optimize the design of virtual worlds, and provide a means to study the communities evolving in virtual worlds. The visualizations are particularly valuable for analyzing events that are spread out in time and/or space or events that involve a very large number of participants. The paper reviews and builds upon research in information visualization, scientific visualization, geography, architecture, and social science. It discusses intended user groups and their tasks and how the proposed techniques support those tasks. Three dimensional virtual world technologies are briefly described before the visualization tool set is explained in detail together with sample applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of results and an outlook for future work.

<p>National governments around the world have started committing substantial resources to creating the environment and infrastructure for doing business electronically with their citizens, businesses, and other government entities. However, to stay in tune with this internet economy, the skills and knowledge of their citizens and employees need to be continually updated and refreshed. E-learning provides the vehicle for this continuous education and training. The purpose of this research is to identify the infrastructure and e-learning technologies that are currently available for creating a comprehensive online education and training environment that supports development of government workforce. The research surveys and provides a review of the latest technological developments and practices in e-learning to help the professionals, managers, and policy makers of both profit and non-profit organisations to identify the areas of information technologies they can invest to bring about efficiency and cost savings in continuous education and training. The research also identifies several research projects within the area to further advance the field.

<p>The use of Collaborative Virtual Environments in e-learning is one of the most promising uses of the virtual reality technology. While a lot of research has been done in the area of collaborative virtual environments corresponding to the sharing of events, very little research has been done on specific services and functionality. However both the requirements and the kind of the offered services affect significantly the design of a system. In this paper we present an Educational Community to support e-learning services using Collaborative Virtual Environments from both the technical and functional point of view.

<p>The Instructional Technology Program at Appalachian State University has moved significant components of the program, including course experiences, into a 3D virtual world. The process of developing this world and interacting with students through this medium raises some fundamental questions about teaching and learning, particularly as it relates to distance education. This paper describes the effort and explores some of these questions.

<p>The development of online opportunities for distance education is an important priority in higher education. At Appalachian State University, the principles of social constructivism inform our thinking as we construct teaching and learning environments. Our experience suggests 3D immersive virtual worlds support deep learning and can help learners make meaning in ways similar to those used outside of virtual environments. Virtual worlds such as AET Zone offer participants a sense of presence, immediacy, movement, artifacts, and communications unavailable within traditional Internet-based learning environments. This paper will report our experiences with an award-winning virtual, immersive learning environment. The results of these experiences highlight the efficacy for the formation of authentic communities within 3D web-based worlds as online distance education environments continue to evolve.

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology of this article is to interpret and evaluate the characteristics of a virtual world for its learning potential. Findings - This article finds that Second Life is not simply the latest online fad, but part of a continuum of instructional technology tools that corresponds to twentieth and twenty-first century developments in educational theory. Originality/value - Second Life has just started in the past year and a half to be used for educational activities, with just a handful of US higher education courses. Numerous issues are now being discussed in the media and education list-serves about the value of Second Life as a learning tool.

It provides an elaboration of how various components of the learning environment are designed to support this theoretical underpinning that fits to the new paradigm of instruction. This is followed by the suggestion of a theoretical framework that can be used to guide the design of other virtual reality-based learning environments. This framework can also act as an initial structure that is to be further refined and/or revised, as a robust model model to guide the design and development of a learning environment using this technology is still unavailable at the present time.

</li></ul>
<p>The paper outlines a new paradigm and its underlying rationales for implementing networked learning environments that is emerging from new technologies such as multi-user platform, virtual worlds, virtual learning community, and intelligent agents. The proposed paradigm of the networked learning environments is described as inhabited virtual learning worlds (IVLW), which is a shared learning space in 3-D format and populated with avatars that are the representations of learners who are geographically dispersed around the world. The virtual learning worlds are also composed of objects such as intelligent agents and learning materials. A pilot system is created based on the discussed rationales of inhabited virtual learning worlds. A preliminary empirical study focusing on the selected learning behaviors in young learners also has been conducted with the pilot system. The results of the empirical study and suggestions for enhancing the pilot system are discussed in the closing section of the article.

<p>This paper examines two sides of a coin that relate to learning from dialogue. The first side of our coin relates to the role of dialogue in learning; the second side is related to the part that observations of learning dialogues can play in the design of computer-based learning environments. In order to define the scope of the paper, various complementary research question are examined. For example, one question is how and why does one learn from dialogue? A second question is how, or to what extent, can theories and studies of dialogue and interaction be exploited in a concrete way by designers of interactive media for education? Following a review of related literature I present my main argument, namely that the evolutionary approach provides a model by which research in learning, teaching and theories of interaction can jointly feed into the design process of learning technology. This is followed by an exposition of the evolutionary approach. There are three aspects to what I am terming an evolutionary approach to learning technology theory: (i) theories/models of teaching, learning and interaction, (ii) empirical observations of learning, and (iii) interactive learning environment design and implementation. The purpose of this evolutionary approach is the mapping out of not a specific theory, but how people are working towards the creation of theories. The evolutionary approach involves a constant process which slowly takes the educational technology field forward in iterative steps. In order to concretise the evolutionary approach, I examine the work of selected researchers, in the field of dialogue in learning, in the context of the identified three points of evolution. I conclude by suggesting that the evolutionary model can help designers of, and researchers into, learning technology in various important ways.

It presents definitions of key terms and analyses the learner-computer interactions facilitated by 3DLEs, in order to identify the unique characteristics of such environments It is argued that the most important potential contribution of 3DLEs to conceptual understanding is through facilitation of spatial knowledge
development. The effectiveness of 3DLEs for spatial learning is discussed, drawing on literature from a range of disciplines. Aspects of a research agenda are identified including exploration of the characteristics of 3DLEs that are most important for spatial learning along with issues in designing appropriate learning tasks.

</li></ul>
<p>Recent research demonstrates that videogames enhance literacy, attention, reaction time, and higher-level thinking. Several scholars have suggested that massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) such as Everquest and Second Life have educational potential, but we have little data about what happens when such tools are introduced in the classroom. This paper reports findings from two MMO-based courses in the context of situated learning theory. The first course, focused on the ethnography of on-line games, used the game Everquest as a vehicle for teaching research methods to 36 students in an undergraduate communication course. The second course used the game Second Life to teach the fundamentals of videogame design and criticism. Synthesizing comments from student web logs with data collected from follow-up surveys, the paper highlights key findings and offers concrete suggestions for instructors contemplating the use of multiplayer games in their own courses. Recommending that potential virtual environments be selected on the basis of genre, accessibility, and extensibility, it is suggested that game-based assignments are most effective when they build bridges between the domain of the game world and an overlapping domain of professional practice.

</li></ul>
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds are a new technology that holds some promise as constructivist learning environments for distance education. This investigation presents an evaluative case study of the pedagogical implications of using one 3D virtual world, Active Worlds, for synchronous distance education. The research design for this qualitative study focuses on the pedagogical affordances and constraints. Methods employed in the data collection include participatory observations, class logs, and formal and informal interviews with the instructor of a synchronous distance learning course offered through Active Worlds University. Findings reveal that although Active Worlds provides tools that support constructivist learning environments, the affordances and constraints of the tools (discourse, experiential, and resource) may, to varying degrees, impact the pragmatic use of this medium. While this initial investigation reveals that this technology supports constructivist learning environments, more research needs to be conducted to fully explore the potential of 3D virtual worlds as both distance and traditional classroom learning environments.

<p>Online three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds are emerging technologies that offer unique learning opportunities for traditional and distributed education. One of the more popular 3D virtual worlds, Active Worlds, is currently being used as a medium for synchronous and asynchronous distance learning. This investigation presents two exploratory case studies of different, but exemplary educational activities using Active Worlds for formal and informal education. The focus of each case study is to investigate how Active Worlds is being used for distance learning and to determine the type of learning experiences afforded by this 3D virtual environment. Whilst more research is necessary to explore fully the potential of 3D virtual worlds for learning, this initial investigation illustrates how Active Worlds affords opportunities for experiential learning and situated learning within a collaboration learning environment.

<p>During the past two decades, the popularity of computer and video games has prompted games to become a source of study for educational researchers and instructional designers investigating how various aspects of game design might be appropriated, borrowed, and re-purposed for the design of educational materials. The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of how the structure in massively multiple online role-playing games (MMORPGs) might inform the design of interactive learning and game-based learning environments by looking at the elements which support intrinsic motivation. Specifically, this analysis presents (a) an overview of the two primary elements in MMORPGs game design: character design and narrative environment, (b) a discussion of intrinsic motivation in character role-playing, (c) a discussion of intrinsic motivational supports and cognitive support of the narrative structure of small quests, and (d) a discussion of how the narrative structure of MMORPGs might foster learning in various types of knowledge.

<p>The article focuses on online gaming as an educational tool in training and learning. It is underlined that massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) offer an unpredictable three-dimensional environment for players to experience a virtual world through their own player character along with other players. It is stated that the number of online games for education and training purposes are limited. Due to the success at engaging large groups of remotely located users, military training organizations have started to use multiplayer online role-play gaming approaches.

<p>Businesses, universities, K-12 schools, and various consortia are exploring the possibilities of using virtual worlds (VWs) for communication, collaboration, and instruction delivery. This review is written from the perspective of an educator new to Second Life (SL). The nature of VWs and SL, and resources to join and acquire survival skills in SL are presented. The potential for learning and collaboration in VWs is discussed in light of representative projects and initiatives across business and educational organizations. Concerns about SL and hurdles that educators might face when they attempt to be effective in a virtual environment are explored. Cognitive mapping is suggested as a research methodology for examining the potential of VWs for learning.

</li></ul>
<p>The evaluation of virtual learning environments (VLEs) and similar applications has, to date, largely consisted of checklists of system features, phenomenological studies or measures of specific forms of educational efficacy. Although these approaches offer some value, they are unable to capture the complex and holistic nature of a group of individuals using a common system to support the wide range of activities that make up a course or programme of study over time. This paper employs Wenger's theories of 'communities of practice' to provide a formal structure for looking at how a VLB supports a pre-existing course community. Wenger proposes a Learning Architecture Framework for a learning community of practice, which the authors have taken to provide an evaluation framework. This approach is complementary to both the holistic and complex natures of course environments, in that particular VLE affordances are less important than the activities of the course community in respect of the system. Thus, the VLB's efficacy in its context of use is the prime area of investigation rather than a reductionist analysis of its tools and components. An example of this approach in use is presented, evaluating the VLE that supports the undergraduate medical course at the University of Edinburgh. The paper provides a theoretical grounding, derives an evaluation instrument, analyses the efficacy and validity of the instrument in practice and draws conclusions as to how and where it may best be used.

<p>A chorus of proclamations have arisen in recent years about the potential of games and
simulations to facilitate learning. Yet few discussions focus on the fundamental issue
surrounding the implementation of games and simulations: to what learning objectives and
pedagogical strategies are they most relevant? Through an examination of perspectives on the
suitability of games for learning, as well as recent examples of digital game-based training in two
vocational settings, this paper examines the design of authentic learning experiences as a way of
thinking about the appropriateness and unique potential of games and simulations in a range of
educational and training settings.

</li></ul>
<p>There has been a significant body of work in recent years in the development of e-learning tools and products. The main focus has been on models that are developed from the constructivist tradition, based on the notion that learners actively construct their own understanding and knowledge from their experiences. The topic of this paper is the possible future use of computer games technologies and games based narrative to support e-learning and as a tool for lifelong learning. Computer games metaphors and underpinning models are inherently constructivist, the gaming format is also chosen for its ability to engage. The gaming format also lends itself to support the known advantages of narrative from oral traditions and fits with the younger generation's interest in current trends in the entertainment industry. The decision to adopt a game-based approach to the development of e-learning follows on from a survey of current state-of-the art support for lifelong learning that was carried out by the authors, a key element of that investigation being the different techniques to improve learning and retention through engagement of the student. The increased availability of high bandwidth connections to support multi-user, graphics-rich environments such as gaming environments supports the use of these gaming technologies for virtual learning environments. The use of storytelling in education provides us with a mechanism to establish a relationship between games and virtual learning environments, there have been numerous trials of the use of on-line games setups suitable for this purpose in the form of simulations, MUDs and adventure games. During the last few years multiple virtual worlds have been developed for general communication between users from different parts of the world, and these can be used to support all the important social aspects of learning. From the perspective of our research we are interested in designing a model for an online games-based leaning environment using narrative models, which will then be developed as an exemplar of this particular approach.

</li></ul>
<p>During the last decade, there have been significant changes in higher education, particularly in the emergence of distance education and the 24/7- access mantra (24 hours a day, seven days a week). This, in turn, has had a continuing impact upon efforts to reconceptualize what an academic library is and what it does. Not surprisingly, academic libraries face a number of critical issues, including increased costs of resources, expansion of traditional services, increased competition from other information vendors, and the impact of new technologies. Although these issues appear as threats, they are opportunities for libraries to design their own future (Denham, 1995).In the near future, academic libraries will remain a vital resource for faculty, students, and staff. While it is easy for academic libraries to become complacent about their status within a university since there is no competition on campus, successful marketing programs can enhance visibility, create understanding about the value of the library, and shape public perception of the scope of its resources and services (Gómez, 2001). This chapter will briefly look at marketing issues in academic libraries, how those issues were dealt with in marketing the Virtual Library, and where marketing for academic libraries may be going in the future as the physical and virtual worlds shift, meld, and merge.

<p>Pedagogical theory of today gives high priority to social components of learning. Within the field of computer supported learning there are many attempts to acknowledge this. One approach involves the addition of virtual characters to electronic learning environments. Such character enhanced systems are the focus of the present article. Firstly, a systematic overview is given of pedagogical benefits that have been proposed in the literature regarding character enhancement of electronic learning environments, for example increased motivation, stimulation of particular learning activities, enhanced flow of communication and fulfillment of a need for deeper personal relationships in learning. Secondly, I examine the empirical results presented in the literature with respect to the proposed positive pedagogical effects. Based on these reviews, I finally discuss possible directions for continued research and design in the field from a pedagogical point of view. I propose a research agenda for the near future and conclude with some reflections on a longer-term perspective.

<p>This paper suggests that some of the needs for transferable skills in general, and in particular for the gaming industry, can be met by the appropriate use of gaming and virtual world environments. We hope to show that virtual worlds provide a logical progression in the use of computer mediated learning tools within a constructivist pedagogical perspective. We briefly discuss the educational properties of virtual
worlds and in particular that of Second Life. We propose a project for developing group work which seeks to link affordances in the environment to learning outcomes and employs a socially-situated, constructivist pedagogical framework derived from educational learning theory.

<p>Although prior research has shown that generating explanations encourages students to learn new content with deeper understanding and to monitor their own comprehension more effectively, helping students learn how to explain properly remains a significant challenge. This study investigated the use of software agents as learning partners in an activity where students generated explanations about river ecosystem concepts. The results of the experiment demonstrated that software agents can have a positive impact as learning partners in a virtual world environment. It was found that the agents encouraged the use of explanation resources designed to help students generate more effective explanations. Students working with the agents generated deeper explanations than students who did not interact with an agent. Implications for the design of learning environments with agents as learning partners are discussed.

<p>Early research argued that computer-mediated communication (CMC) had a number of advantages over existing communication media for supporting collaboration. However, a number of papers emerged that began to raise doubts about this positive view. These papers reported difficulties using CMC to support collaboration. Several systems are reported in this special issue that try to overcome these difficulties, either by changing the communication tools or by developing sound social spaces. These systems are important because the right tools and environment are essential; however, recent research suggests that we need to do more than this, because students do not know how to collaborate effectively and they need to develop these skills to use the tools productively. Other papers in this Special Issue suggest ways this might be achieved.

<p>Cyberspace, an information space created through ubiquitously networked computers, has been transformed from fiction to fact in the past decade thanks to the advent of the World Wide Web. Although it can only be experienced through the mediation of computers, it is quickly becoming an alternative stage for everyday economic, cultural, and other human activities. As such, there is a potential and a need to design it according to architectural principles, rather than the prevailing document (page) metaphor. This need is most evident in learning environments, which rely on social and contextual attributes as much as they rely on content. This paper describes the underlying theory and our efforts to develop such virtual learning environments, and the software that allows users to access and inhabit them.

<p>Educators are always looking for ways to reach those they teach. Until now, nearly all extension methods have been primarily asynchronous. Even those with synchronous aspects are still fairly one-dimensional. But the world of nontraditional delivery methods is changing rapidly.  With the growing popularity of multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) such as Second Life learners can now be engaged in ways that are not possible outside the virtual world. With the ability to defy the laws of physics and “real-world” realities, and as the technology behind MUVEs evolves and matures, the face of teaching, learning, and research is evolving and adapting.  This research bulletin examines the current state of Second Life in relationship to the educational environment. Although literature about virtual worlds can be found dating back a number of years, this bulletin will reflect on more recent works that discuss both technological and pedagogical issues. Content will also be drawn from interviews with educators and innovators who are already involved in building an in-world presence, teaching classes, and providing resources to those using Second Life. Finally, now that we are instructing in a virtual world, where does pedagogy go from here?

<p>In this article I argue that, like other technological innovations, the rise of the digital information age is contributing to shape people's mode of cognition. I review the use of computers in teaching and learning in terms of their impact on our ability to (1) process parallel data, (2) access information in a non-linear order, and (3) visualize information. I analyse some implications for education stressing the importance of focusing on the meaning and interpretation of information rather than on gathering or memorizing data. In addition, I contend that although hypertextuality is perceived to be dynamic for its engagement with multiple dimensions, it is also a highly mediated form of accessing information. The most significant innovation of the computer, however, is the return to a visually based representation of reality. Paradoxically, the digital visualization of information aids the understanding of abstract concepts while simultaneously increasing conceptual abstraction.

<p>The collaborative educational virtual environment supposes the active participation of students and teachers, interacting highly and aiming at knowledge exchange and creation of new abilities. The learning becomes a process in which one assists the other to reach the objective, by exchanging experiences, dialogues, discussion of ideas, accomplishments of the group, and individual activities that can be shared with the group, allowing the creation of knowledge based on collective involvement. In this context, this paper describes and discusses the aspects and methods of interaction between students and teachers in collaborative educational virtual environments and presents an application based on the Virtual Teacher Project.

The user can interact with the VMC, which is composed of three dimensional objects, images, animations, text (ASCII or three-dimensional) and sound. To prove the feasibility of the system only a small part of the teaching material was digitised and some experimental results are presented in the article.

</li></ul>
<p>Virtual environments are able to extend the space of interaction beyond the classroom. In order to analyze how distributed cognition functions in such an extended space, we suggest focusing on the architecture of intersubjectivity. The Euroland project--a virtual land created and populated by seven classrooms supported by a team of researchers--was analyzed with the aim of tracking down the process and the structure of intersubjectivity. Participants were located in different cities in two countries-Italy and the Netherlands. At the end of the project, the initial empty virtual world was filled with virtual artifacts borne from the intersubjective process. A group of ten 13-year-old students was observed throughout the project. Seven videotapes were collected in the classroom. By analyzing the videotapes, a set of episodes revealing intersubjectivity was captured and discussed. Intersubjectivity first concerned only participants and tools located in the classroom. Later, partners at a distance and the various communication tools available entered the architecture of intersubjectivity. Finally, intersubjectivity revealed not only information, but the reciprocal perception of the roles and awareness of a joint project. From the episode analysis, recommendations for teachers' use of virtual technology were drawn.

<p>The spectacular development of information and communication technologies through the Internet has provided opportunities for students to explore the virtual world of information. In this article, the author discusses the necessary and sufficient conditions for successful online learning in educational institutions. The necessary conditions include the hardware, software and financial commitment to ensure a good campus network that will support online learning. The sufficient conditions highlight the need for a paradigm shift in learning to build a learning culture in educational institutions, mediated by a strategic plan. These two sets of conditions ensure the important alignment between strategy and Internet technologies grounded in the particular educational concerns of the institution.

<p>The global scope of the CREATE project is to develop a mixed-reality framework that enables highly interactive real-time construction and manipulation of photo-realistic, virtual worlds based on real data sources. This framework will be tested and applied to cultural heritage content in an educational context, as well as to the design and review of architectural/urban planning settings. The evaluation of the project is based on a human-centered, constructivist approach to working and learning, with special attention paid to the evaluation of the resulting mixed reality experience. Through this approach, participants in an activity "construct" their own knowledge by testing ideas and concepts based on their prior knowledge and experience, applying these to a new situation, and integrating the new knowledge gained with pre-existing intellectual constructs. CREATE project uses a high degree of interactivity, and includes provision for other senses (haptics and sound). The application developed in CREATE are designed to run on different platforms, and the targeted running systems are SGI and PC driven, with immersive stereo-displays such as a workbench, a ReaCTor (CAVE-like environment), and a wide projection screen.

</li></ul>
<p>3D virtual worlds facilitate a level of communication and collaboration not readily available in conventional CAD systems. The integration of virtual worlds and CAD systems using a common data model can make a significant impact on synchronous collaboration and real-time multiuser multidisciplinary modification of building data. By using agents, the integration of 3D virtual worlds and CAD systems can go beyond that of passive data transfer. With sensors and effectors, each agent can interact with its environment by responding to changes in the CAD system or 3D virtual world, which can take the form of an update to the geometry or as a recommendation to change non-geometric information or to propagate changes to other parts of the design. The reasoning process for each agent can vary from a reflexive behavior, in which the agent responds directly to the sensor data to a reflective behavior in which the agents reasons about its goals and alternatives before making a change to the environment. We demonstrate this approach using ArchiCAD and Active Worlds as the CAD system and the virtual world platform. An EDM database is used as the central repository for storing the representation of the relevant data model. A multi-agent system is developed to connect the virtual world to this database to allow active data sharing. This agent approach can be extended to the integration of other applications and data models.

<p>The future of the academic library is a topic of continuing concern for the profession, but usually the boundaries of projected visions are set firmly in the issues and debates of the day. What means might be found to break open those constraints and encourage visions projected further into the future? In the fall of 2002, a unique partnership between the New Jersey ACRL (Association of Colleges and Research Libraries) and Fairleigh Dickinson University Libraries initiated a quest for fresh thinking about the future by organizing an essay contest with the topic "The Academic Library in 2012". The horizon was set at 2012 because it was felt to be far enough out that current issues would not automatically limit the thinking of those taking part in the contest. Prize money was offered as an incentive to motivate participation despite an abbreviated time frame, and the call went out through various lists popular with the profession.

<p>There is some evidence that Virtual Reality (VR) can contribute to raise interest and motivation in students and to effectively support knowledge transfer, since the learning process can be settled within an experiential framework. However, the practical potential of VR is still being explored: understanding how to use Virtual Reality to support training and learning activities presents a substantial challenge for the designers and evaluators of this learning technology. This chapter has the main aim of discussing the rationale and main benefits for the use of virtual environments in education and training. A number of key attributes of VR environments will be described and discussed in relationship to educational theory and pedagogical practice, in order to establish a possible theoretical basis for VR learning. Significant research and projects carried out in this field will be also presented, together with suggestions and guidelines for future development of VR learning systems.

<p>This paper describes an exploratory, observational study using a purposive sample selection to determine if the presence indicators of the well regarded Community of Inquiry model can be a useful tool to observe and assess learning events which use a Multi User Virtual Environment (MUVE) as the mode of delivery [1]. Specific research questions addressed include whether the Community of Inquiry is recognizable in a MUVE learning environment, if new presence indicators are required if observing a MUVE learning event and finally, does the community of inquiry offer a base rubric to determine the educational effectiveness of learning events which take place in a MUVE? The results are promising; while new presence indicators add breadth to understanding the nature of learning in an immersive environment the core construct of the community of inquiry does indeed transfer to this emerging learning technology.

<p>The evolving growth in networking and telecommunication technologies leads to their enhanced usage in many and different aspects of human activity. One of the technologies that shows great interest is Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs), which may be used in various applications, such as tele-education. This paper presents, analyzes and evaluates the basic elements of Elearn, a Collaborative Virtual Learning Environment (CVLE) that has been created for teaching electronic commerce. In Elearn, the virtual world, the web pages and the synchronous chat among the participants are integrated into the same environment.
A user is represented as an avatar who can move, make gestures with its hands and head, bump into objects, pass through them, etc. A detailed list of navigation directions is provided in order to help the user  to move freely into the environment. The possibility of many users to coexist in Elearn is also supported. Collaboration and cooperation are its two components that enhance the learning effectiveness. Collaboration is supported among students and teachers with the use of synchronous chat. The chat window appears on the screen along with the virtual world and the web pages, motivating the participants to use it. Asynchronous communication is also supported, via email and discussion board. The evaluation of a CVLE is an important and difficult task. Pedagogical issues, like conceptual learning, collaboration, constructivism and adaptability, should be taken under serious consideration. These parameters are crucial in achieving strong learning effectiveness. An evaluation table has been developed which includes all the important parameters concerning a CVLE.

<p>The present article is a part of a project for the measurement of presence in educational virtual environments (VEs), since presence is correlated with higher levels of cognitive performance and emotional development, factors that contribute to knowledge construction. The aim of our study was to investigate the sense of presence of 12-year-old pupils within an educational VE representing an ancient Greek house through a sense of embodiment and the ability to handle task performance, while using various peripheral devices. This is the first report on presence measurement with children, based on the indication that children and adults may apply very unrelated criteria. Our results showed statistically significant differences on the level of tiredness and ease of use in using six different input devices. The combination of the keyboard and mouse and the keyboard on its own were the least tedious and easiest input devices, giving a sense of presence as stated by the pupils. Environmental richness and the high level of interactivity within the VE resulted in a high degree of presence for almost all the pupils. The majority of them felt a sense of presence whilst driving the avatar, indicating that presence is significantly correlated with pupils' degree of association with their virtual bodies. All the pupils felt a sense of presence when wearing the head-mounted display. Our findings are in line with those of other researchers and show evidence of personal, social and environmental presence.

</li></ul>
<p>The explosion of interest in online gaming and virtual worlds is leading many universities to investigate possible educational applications of the new environments. In this paper we explore the possibilities of 3D online worlds for teacher education, particularly the field experience component. Drawing upon two pedagogical examples, we suggest that virtual simulations may, with certain limitations, create safe spaces that allow pre-service teachers to adopt alternate identities and interact safely with the  other.” In so doing they may become aware of the constructed nature of social categories and gain the essential pedagogical skill of perspective-taking. We suggest that,   ultimately, the ability to be the principal creators of themselves in virtual environments can increase their ability to do the same in the real world.
