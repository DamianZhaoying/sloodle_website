</p><p>Location: SL Student Union/ Sandbox
</p><p>Attended:
Jeremy Kabumpo
Greylin Fairweather
Fidgette Kiwi
Frunobulax Dwi
EmanonEvahi Dwi
</p><p><b>Topics covered</b>
</p><p>The group met initially in the student union (SU). Jeremy shared that Linda Main, 
SLIS Associate Director was impressed with the Second Life (SL) builders. 
</p><p>Greylin shared the experience of hosting a tour and presentation for her teen resources class-LIBR 262; pointing out that teaching basic SL skills, such as walking, was a difficult hurdle to surmount.
</p><p>The team moved to the Sandbox (SB) for the remainder of the meeting. The team builders were thanked for all their time and effort. We started the meeting sitting on revolving rings; which found one member found difficult due to the spinning. Much discussion ensued about how to best meet and sit as a group. It was suggested that we try doing it the “old school” way by sitting on the grass. One member noted she didn’t know that you could sit on the grass. 
</p><p>Jeremy shared that he had met with Linda Main at a 2-hour meeting and that she is enthusiastic about SL as it pertains to SLIS. 
</p><p>Jeremy invited each member to share progress. Greylin shared that she was especially interested in teaching tools in SL. She wants to be able to show teachers how they can best utilize SL. She made an outdoor classroom for the 262 presentation using tools from her class. In stall A, she made a display of 3 assignments. Creating a short of  “V-Portfolio” (virtual), which she presented to the class via Elluminate. As part of the presentation she invited fellow classmates in for a tour with explicit instructions for accessing SL. She reiterated the difficulties discussed earlier on in our meeting regarding newbies navigating inworld (IW).
</p><p>Frunobulax talked about shooting video on the Olympic Memorial in order to bring it into the SL possibly 3-D, if skill set improves. EmanonEvahi discussed the finishing up of the SU by adding the remaining furniture, notecards etc as well as artwork from SJSU SU. The Dwi’s would continue to chronicle. Jeremy mentioned that URLs could be imbedded in the notecards by checking out Kirkby/125/220. 
</p><p>Greylin propose a virtual social for SLIS students and faculty with trivia, landmarks, notecards and freebies such as SJSU SLIS shirts along with the Island tour HUD. She felt that the purpose or advantage of this environment over Blackboard (BB) was the social aspect.  Jeremy mentioned he would like to start up a Qualoquia series of library and info sys notables and perhaps make it a social setting.
</p><p>The group chatted about the building of professor’s offices.  Currently Constantino and Achterman have labeled offices. Greylin brought up the need for very large signage for each section. During her tour/presentation, folks had a difficulty reading the signs around the island.
</p><p><b>New items discussed were:</b> 
</p><p>-	SL computing requirements being rolled into the larger SJSU SLIS requirements.
-	SJSU SLIS has a link to the wiki: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://slisweb.sjsu.edu/sl">http://slisweb.sjsu.edu/sl</a>.
-	Student mentor system underway for Elluminate to be copied for SL (students will be able to take 298 and lend assistance in classrooms for faculty)
-	2 students to be hired to assist with coding of Sloodle course system.
-	Looking for external grant funding for SJSU SLIS to become a national center for innovations in SL for learning.
-	90 faculty members will attend an institute in May. A presentation on SL as a teaching platform will be given with the focus on research and grant opportunities for them as well as the basic “what is SL” speech.
-	A “Machinima for Learning and Social Change” fest will be held in May. 
-	ALA gave the Info Island libraries an award for innovation to be held in Washington DC on June 26th. All are invited to attend and accept award. In addition, there is an exhibit on the Hill for congressional review – A show and tell.
-	Loertscher will be adding some buildings as part of his Knowville project.
-	Grey is doing a Machinima book talk of Fanboy and Gothgirl and need two volunteers to pose in kindly high school sim for approximately 20 minutes.
-	Jonathon Richter has a building in the research area on E-portfolios, which will be presented in Chicago next week at the AERA.
Anyone who would like to access the Teen grid (with faculty in tow) will be sponsored for background checks. LM will pay for it. See more information at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ascertainsi.com/secondlife/bgConsent.asp">https://www.ascertainsi.com/secondlife/bgConsent.asp</a>.
-	A speaker series as well as moving forward on projects in support of Sloodle, Knowville, and e-Portfolios (v-Portfolios) is underway.
</p><p>Frunobulax wanted to learn more about Machinima. Greylin suggested links from SimTeach and Fraps (free program) to capture video inworld. Jeremy mentioned that Fraps was for PC’s and SnapzPro was for Macs.
</p><p>The possibility of getting Richie Partinton, a student who works with David Loertscher, to do a book talk in the SL environment was broached.  Greylin believed he could be so enticed if the voice capabilities of SL are available as a delivery option.  Jeremy proposes having a guest speaker come in for 90 minutes - every 2-3 weeks.
</p><p>Most of the library of SJSU SLIS video will be available on the island for viewing and we will be porting our live video sessions in for big occasions, according to Jeremy.
</p><p>Knowville (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://knowville.org">http://knowville.org</a>), a prototype project from San Jose State University that challenges kids to read a BILLION books, write a BILLION books, and do a BILLION projects. Really! And there will be counters so you can watch the numbers grow. The site already has some great ideas any of us can use.
</p><p>(Jeremy proposes to link this sister site to ours, specifically the Teen Grid.)
</p><p>Greylin noted that a background check is necessary for adults to work on Knowville.  Jeremy believes that Linda Main will approve payment for the check.
</p><p>The team posed several suggestions for bringing increased student and faculty traffic into the site:
</p><p>•	Speaker Series
•	Projects in support of Sloodle; Knowville; and E-Portfolios
•	Giving a “Social,” giving away T-shirts, SL landmarks, notecards, and the Island Tour HUD.
•	The use of student volunteers on a reference/ intake desk.
•	Using MYSJSU messaging system or SLISADMIN to invite folks in
•	Creating a very short Machinima “Basic Movement” with narration.
•	Teleport balls for moving people from place to place on the SLSU Island.
</p><p>Jeremy notes that we need a "falling off a log" tutorial for the uninitiated, perhaps in three available modes: video / quick reference / step-by-step. In addition, he shared comments on the difficulty of creating videos when wikis are a more efficient way of working on shared documents. Greylin shared the address to her website which contained a number of items useful to the group
<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://robint.williams.googlepages.com/computergeekchic">http://robint.williams.googlepages.com/computergeekchic</a>.
</p><p>Fidgette indicated she was working on a SL glossary, acronyms index, as well as a general chat acronyms index from information gleaned from the Internet and SL. A variety of terms were discussed amongst the team such as “grief” and “push”.  She asked if for the team to send any glossaries, etc we come across. Greylin mentioned that Enid Irwin had a great chat acronym and she would write her for the link. 
</p><p>The group chatted about using streaming video in the SU and whether YouTube could be used. QuickTime is the only stream available in SL. Frunobulax wanted to show the classic Dali/Brunel film, “An Adalusian Dog” as part of the Surreal World Café scenario and if by the film being in public domain its showing would be considered fair use. According to Jeremy, all that is needed is to give him a URL like: "<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="rtsp://stream.simteach.com/stream.simteach.com/SLISinSL_3_14_07.mov">rtsp://stream.simteach.com/stream.simteach.com/SLISinSL_3_14_07.mov</a>". 
</p><p>A fair amount of discussion about the fair use act on the surreal artwork ensued. According to Jeremy, the exhibitor must own anything visible in SL. For example, you could not upload a photo from the web and then display it on a prim. According to EmanonEvahi, the art was uploaded from Wikipedia, which indicated we merely had to list the fair use information. Jeremy seemed to believe this might be okay. Further research is needed to be certain that we are in compliance. There is a gray area regarding books covers; however RL photos taken by group, SL snapshots or movies could be used w/o permission.
</p><p>See URL for more information: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fair_use">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fair_use</a>
</p><p>The following information was gleaned from the Wikipedia site regarding fair use:
</p><p>This image is of a drawing, painting, print, or other two-dimensional work of art, and the copyright for it is most likely owned by either the artist who produced the image, the person who commissioned the work, or the heirs thereof. It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of works of art. Fair use is a legal doctrine, which may permit the use of copyrighted material on Wikipedia under a restricted set of criteria. It is not a blanket permission to use text, images or other copyrighted materials freely on Wikipedia. Content used under this doctrine on Wikipedia must meet the United States legal tests for fair use. Furthermore, Wikipedia places additional restrictions on "fair use" of copyrighted material; the image or content can only be used if it is not replaceable with a free content image. This might, for example, allow for the inclusion of a photo documenting a historical event such as the Hindenburg disaster, but a simple publicity still of a vehicle, building or living person will be subject to much greater scrutiny.
An editor uploading copyrighted material to Wikipedia must provide a detailed fair use rationale; otherwise the uploaded material will be deleted.
</p><p><br /> 
<b>Task lists for the next few weeks:</b>
</p><p>•	Jeremy Kabumpo: “Falling off” log for easy reference for faculty; proposal to Internet librarian; finish syllabus for summer 3-credit course; recruit 2 paid coders and more 298 folks for summer school.
•	Fidgette Kiwi: continue working to develop SL glossary; continue with Costantino’s office, <i>Additional information to be added</i>
•	EmanonEvahi Dwi: Finish up Student Union; get permission from SJSU regarding artwork image use; addition of fair use info; document this meeting, chronicle progress as needed; assist Fidgette with Costantino’s office when she responds.
•	Frunobulax Dwi: Create Olympic monument; embed notecards in artwork in SU; work on chronicling as needed.
•	Greylin Fairweather: <i>Information to be added</i>
</p><p>Next meeting is scheduled for Thursday, April 12th @ 9:30pm. Group to meet in the Sandbox area.
